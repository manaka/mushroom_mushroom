For your assessment, I would like to ask you to look at the following dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

In short, I would like you to create an app in which you can filter out mushrooms that meet specific attributes.
For example, I would like to see a list of all mushrooms that are edible, have a brown gill-color, and two rings.
The dataset contains 8124 types of mushrooms, each with 23 different attributes:

- edible
- cap-shape
- cap-surface
- cap-color
- bruises?
- odor
- gill-attachment
- gill-spacing
- gill-size
- gill-color
- stalk-shape
- stalk-root
- stalk-surface-above-ring
- stalk-surface-below-ring
- stalk-color-above-ring
- stalk-color-below-ring
- veil-type
- veil-color
- ring-number
- ring-type
- spore-print-colororange
- population
- habitat

I would like to see a front-end that enables me to filter out the mushrooms that have one of more of the attributes that I can select.
Also I would like to be able to reset the filters. This means you will have to:

- Import and process the dataset
- Make model/views/controller choices
- Make smart database queries and a minimal front-end
- Optionally, hosting considerations and front-end design choices. It would also be great to see some tests for your code.

You can make it work locally so that I can run the code and see it work, or host it somewhere if you want.
The important thing is that I can see the choices you make in this process, and the reasoning behind it, more than the actual result itself.
Therefore I'd like to ask you to commit everything into a repository, so I can see the steps you've made.
Please don't put too much time into it. If you feel it takes too long, just stop after a while and send me the results up to that moment.
I'll be available for any questions you may have.

Of course I'd like you to use Rails, but if you want to use other languages to make your life easier, that's fine.
If you have any questions, let me know.
If you feel the assessment is too much, remember it's just about the process and even a couple steps will be good enough, and you don't need to do all I asked for.
But still, if you have issues with this assessment (like if you really dislike mushrooms), let me know, and I can send you something smaller.
